## 🚀 What is KYSYN?

KYSYN is the native **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** semantic engine that transforms your local codebase into a queryable knowledge graph. Unlike common AI assistants that treat code as flat text, KYSYN understands deep structures (AST), cross-file relationships, and logical semantics.

### 🧠 Why KYSYN?
Traditional AI assistants often fail because they lack architectural awareness. KYSYN solves this by providing:
- **Surgical Precision:** Beyond vector search—Tri-Hybrid analysis (AST + Vectors + Relationship Graph).
- **Total Privacy:** Runs 100% offline on your hardware. No data ever leaves your machine.
- **Universal Integration:** As an MCP-native tool, it instantly connects to **Cursor, Claude Desktop, Zed**, and any compatible environment.

## 🛠️ How It Works (High-Level)

KYSYN acts as the neural infrastructure between your code and your favorite AI:

1. **Ingestion:** KYSYN parses your files locally, building an optimized SQLite-backed graph.
2. **Intelligence:** It extracts symbols, functions, and dependencies to understand "who calls what."
3. **Delivery:** It serves only the perfect, necessary context to the AI, slashing hallucinations and token waste.

## 📅 Future & Roadmap

KYSYN’s future is driven by its community. 
- 📍 **Public Roadmap:** [Link to your GitHub Projects Board]
- 💡 **Suggestions:** Open a "Feature Request" in the Issues tab to propose new capabilities.
